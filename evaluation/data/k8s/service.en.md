# Service

A key aim of Services in Kubernetes is that you don't need to modify your existing
application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism.
You can run code in Pods, whether this is a code designed for a cloud-native world, or
an older app you've containerized. You use a Service to make that set of Pods available
on the network so that clients can interact with it.

If you use a Deployment to run your app,
that Deployment can create and destroy Pods dynamically. From one moment to the next,
you don't know how many of those Pods are working and healthy; you might not even know
what those healthy Pods are named.
Kubernetes Pods are created and destroyed
to match the desired state of your cluster. Pods are ephemeral resources (you should not
expect that an individual Pod is reliable and durable).

Each Pod gets its own IP address (Kubernetes expects network plugins to ensure this).
For a given Deployment in your cluster, the set of Pods running in one moment in
time could be different from the set of Pods running that application a moment later.

This leads to a problem: if some set of Pods (call them "backends") provides
functionality to other Pods (call them "frontends") inside your cluster,
how do the frontends find out and keep track of which IP address to connect
to, so that the frontend can use the backend part of the workload?

Enter _Services_.

## Services in Kubernetes

The Service API, part of Kubernetes, is an abstraction to help you expose groups of
Pods over a network. Each Service object defines a logical set of endpoints (usually
these endpoints are Pods) along with a policy about how to make those pods accessible.

For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with
3 replicas.  Those replicas are fungible&mdash;frontends do not care which backend
they use.  While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the
frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep
track of the set of backends themselves.

The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

Canary deployments are a common use case for Services. To learn what's involved, follow the [Deploy a Release Using a Canary Deployment](/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/canary-deployment/) tutorial.

The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined
by a selector that you
define.
To learn about other ways to define Service endpoints,
see [Services _without_ selectors](#services-without-selectors).

If your workload speaks HTTP, you might choose to use an
[Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to control how web traffic
reaches that workload.
Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as the entry point for your
cluster. An Ingress lets you consolidate your routing rules into a single resource, so
that you can expose multiple components of your workload, running separately in your
cluster, behind a single listener.

The [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/#what-is-the-gateway-api) API for Kubernetes
provides extra capabilities beyond Ingress and Service. You can add Gateway to your cluster -
it is a family of extension APIs, implemented using
CustomResourceDefinitions -
and then use these to configure access to network services that are running in your cluster.

### Cloud-native service discovery

If you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application,
you can query the API server
for matching EndpointSlices. Kubernetes updates the EndpointSlices for a Service
whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes.

For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load
balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

Either way, your workload can use these [service discovery](#discovering-services)
mechanisms to find the target it wants to connect to.
